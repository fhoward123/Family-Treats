        directions: `1 pkg. yeast
1 c. warm water
1 tsp. sugar
2 Tbsp. oil
2 1/2 c. flour
1 tsp. salt

Dissolve yeast in warm water, with sugar. Stir in remaining ingredients, in the order given (to make sure the salt doesn't kill the yeast). Beat vigorously for 50 strokes. Let dough rest for 5 min. Press dough evenly on a greased oblong pan or baking dish. Top with spaghetti sauce and mozzarella cheese (cheddar will do in a pinch) and any other desired toppings, such a red onion and green peppers (thin strips). Bake at 375 degrees until cheese is just turning light brown, 20-25 min.`,

        name: "Cowboy Quesadillas",
        directions: `Flour tortillas
Cheddar cheese, grated
Black beans, canned, drained
Sauteed onions, if desired
Salsa mixed with a little sour cream to make the sauce (I do this by sight, but maybe 1 cup salsa with about 1/4 cup sour cream, maybe a little less?)

Put some black beans in a flour tortilla. Season them if you like. Top with some cheese and onions, if desired. If you have any fresh spinach, that's super good to add, too. Add in a smidge of the sauce, smeared, on the tortilla, along the side of the beans. Roll up each tortilla, and place in a pan with a little of the sauce spread on the bottom, seam side down. Top all the enchiladas/burritos with sauce just to cover or mostly cover each one, then a little more cheese. Bake at 350 until hot and bubbly, about 20-25 min.

        name: "Bran Muffins",
        directions: `2 c. All Bran cereal
2 c. boiling water

Combine above ingredients and let them sit until they are set. While you're waiting, cream together:

1 c. and 3 Tbsp. Crisco (You also can use coconut oil instead - works great!)
2 1/2 c. sugar

Add in:

4 eggs, one at a time
1 quart buttermilk
4 c. 100% Bran cereal

6 c. flour
5 t. baking soda
2. t. salt
Walnuts or pecans, dates and/or raisins, as desired

Mix everything together in the order given. Bake in muffin tins for 10 minutes at 400 degrees. Just bake what you need. Keep the rest in a tightly covered container - like Tupperware - and store for up to six weeks. Don't stir it again.`,

        name: "Cinnamon Rolls",
        directions: `2 pkg. dry yeast
1/4 c. lukewarm water
1 1/2 c. milk
1/2 c. shortening (I use coconut oil)
3/4 c. sugar
2 tsp salt
2 eggs
1 tsp nutmeg
1/4 tsp. cinnamon
5 c. + all-purpose flour

Soften yeast in warm water; set aside. Scald milk and drop shortening into it to melt it.  Add sugar and salt. Cook to lukewarm. Add 2 cups of the flour. Mix thoroughly. Add eggs. Beat well. Add softened yeast. Mix until smooth. Add nutmeg, cinnamon and remaining flour to make a soft dough. Mix until smooth.

Cover dough with damp cloth and allow to rise in a warm place (80-85 degrees) until doubled - about one hour. Punch down and let rest for 10 minutes. Roll with a rolling pin into a rectangle, about 1/2 inch thick. Spread with softened butter and sprinkle on brown sugar, cinnamon, and also raisins and/or nuts, if desired.

Roll into a "tube" shape and "cut" into 1-inch circles, using thread or embroidery floss. Allow to rise again and bake at 400 degrees for 5-8 minutes.

Remove from oven and glaze while still warm with a mixture of the following, as desired: milk or cream, powdered sugar and vanilla.`,

 1/4 c. powdered sugar
2 eggs
1 c. sugar
2 Tablesp. lemon juice
2 Tablesp. flour
lemon rind, finely grated, from 1/2 to 1 lemon
powdered sugar

Heat over to 325 degrees. Mix flour, butter and powdered sugar. Press into an ungreased, square pan. Bake for about 18 minutes. Beat the rest of the ingredients until light and fluffy - about three minutes. Pour over the hot crust and bake until set - about 20-25 minutes longer, or until very lightly browned. Sprinkle with powdered sugar. This recipe can be doubled and baked in an oblong cake pan. `,

        directions: `3 c. flour
1/3 c. cocoa
I teas. salt
2 C. sugar
2 teas. baking soda

Mix above ingredients together and add the following and mix by HAND (do not use a mixer):

3/4 c. oil
2 Tbsp. vinegar
1 tea. vanilla
2 c. COLD water

Pour into an ungreased rectangular baking pan. If you like, you can mix the cake ingredients in this pan instead of using a bowl. Bake at 350 degrees for about 35 minutes. Frost with mocha frosting, below.

I usually double this as I like plenty of frosting and it seems to be a better amount!

Chocolate Mocha Frosting

1 1/2 c. powdered sugar
3 Tbsp. cocoa
1/4 c. butter, softened
2 Tbsp. hot coffee (decaffeinated)
1 teas. vanilla

Beat ingredients together with a mixer until smooth and creamy.`,
